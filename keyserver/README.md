```

### Configure the server

- Generate the configuration file:
```
⇒  mkdir coniks; cd coniks
⇒  coniksserver init -c # create all files including a self-signed tls keys/cert
```
- By default, the configuration file has two `addresses` entries: the first
is for the registration proxy, the second is the server's public address
for "read-only" requests (lookups, monitoring etc).
- Edit the configuration file as needed:
    - Replace the `loaded_history_length` with the desired number of snapshots kept in memory.
    - Replace the `epoch_deadline` with the desired duration in **seconds**.
    - If using a CONIKS registration proxy, replace the registration proxy `address`. Otherwise, remove the registration proxy `addresses` entry, and add `allow_registration = true` field to the public `addresses` entry.
    - In either case, replace the public `address` with the server's public CONIKS address.
- Test setup (no registration proxy) config file example:
```
[policies]
...
[[addresses]]
    address = "tcp://public.server.address:port" # or "https://public.server.address:port"
    allow_registration = true
    cert = "server.pem"
    key = "server.key"
[logger]
...
```

### Run the server
```
⇒  coniksserver run -p  # run & write down the process ID into coniks.pid
```

You can reload the server's policies while it's running by editing the `config.toml` file
and possibly replace `vrf.priv` with a new key, then run
```
⇒  kill -USR2 `cat coniks.pid`
```
